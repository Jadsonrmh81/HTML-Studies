This project is a thematic tribute to Guns N' Roses, developed to refine my front-end skills in HTML5 and CSS3. It serves as a practical exercise in creating structured, visually engaging layouts.

Key Features:

Band Overview: A concise summary of the band's history and career.
Visual Gallery: A curated collection of iconic 80s photography.
Member Directory: A detailed list of band members with direct links to additional resources.
Album Showcase: A dedicated section featuring five core albums with a custom sidebar layout.

My goal is to continuously improve my development skills through high-quality, hands-on projects.
